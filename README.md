The source code by Curran is on [VizHub](https://vizhub.com/curran/ecb0793c7d674100b3e3133d92cb6957)

This repository used [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) as the JavaScript module bundler.

## View the outcome
Open `public/index.html` in modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox directly. 

## Further development
To further develop the project by updating JavaScript, can run

```javascript

npm run bulid

```

or **watch** changes and auto compile:
```javascript
npm run watch
```

### Note for rollup.config.js settings
The output file format must be 'iife' to make advanced function work.
